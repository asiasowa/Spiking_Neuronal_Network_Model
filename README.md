# Spiking_Neuronal_Network_Model
- In this Jupyter Notebook I used Exponential-Integrate and Fire neuron model to measure such neuronal parameters as firing frequency and interspike interval (ISI)
- Parameters were chosen based on my PhD data and/or scientific literature
- By using interactive widgets from ipywidgets library, the relationship between the amount of injected current and neuronal response can be easily visualized
- Models were written utilizing numpy and pandas and results were visualized with matplotlib and seaborn
- Simulations were run either due to fixed input (amount of external current) or external Poisson processes
- Models consist of a single neuron, a feedforward neuronal population or recurrent neuronal populations
- used nbQA and Black to beautify Python code
